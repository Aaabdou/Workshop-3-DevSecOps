# Workshop #3 -DevSecOps
## Securing a task management web application : Find the vulnerabilities in the code"

### Workshop Instructions

In this hands-on DevSecOps workshop, we will take you through securing a vulnerable web application. This application allows users to register, log in, create tasks, update tasks, and delete tasks. Throughout the session, you will identify and correct security flaws.

We have provided a simple task management application. This app allows users to:

    • Register and log in.
  
    • Create, update, retrieve, and delete tasks.

The goal is to identify the security issues in this application and correct them to make it secure for production use.

We have provided you with two versions of the code in python and java. You can choose either versions according to your preferences. Download the source code and open it in your IDE to start the workshop.
